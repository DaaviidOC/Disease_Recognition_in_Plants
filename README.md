# Disease Recognition in Plants

This project showcases a Data Scientist exercise completed during my training at Upgrade Hub. </br>
[Upgrade Hub](https://www.upgrade-hub.com/) is an educational institution dedicated to offering high-quality training programs in technology and data science. </br>

This repository hosts a project dedicated to the diagnosis of plant diseases through images. Boasting over 122,000 images across 38 different categories of plant diseases, this project aims to advance the automation of plant disease diagnosis, which could have a significant impact on agricultural economics and food security worldwide. </br>

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is highly varied and detailed, featuring images of both healthy and diseased plants. The diseases range from bacterial spot in tomatoes to apple scab, offering a wide spectrum of conditions to train our model. </br>

## Jupyter notebook

Here you will find all the steps to create and train your model.  </br>

We recommend working in Google Colab, as the data volume is high and the model training process will take a long time, consuming a lot of your PC's RAM until it finishes if you run it locally. </br>

## Model

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been used to train and classify the images. CNNs are particularly adept at analyzing images and have proven effective in image classification tasks.

## Streamlit App

We have developed a Streamlit application that allows users to upload their own plant images for diagnosis, where the application processes the image through our model and returns a diagnosis. </br>

You can access the Streamlit app through the following [link](https://apppy-imjfpbdqng9ugjxumauper.streamlit.app/). </br>
